  "description" : "[b]StarCustomChat[/b] is an overwhole mod that rewrites the way chat works in Starbound. \nInstead of a boring, plain text you can now have:\n\n* Two modes inspired by Discord: the compact one and the avatar showcase\n* Plugin and localisation system that allows you to enrich the experience for your own server by adding more functionality to the chat\n* Chat size and color configuration\n* Quick and easy DM panels\n* And many more!\n\nThis mod is client-sided, meaning that you don't have to install it on a server to use. And of course, this is fully compatible with the vanilla game - you will still receive all the messages from people who don't have this mod installed, and they will receive yours.\n\nRequires [url=https://github.com/StarExtensions/StarExtensions]StarExtensions[/url] by Novaenia version 1.9.24+\n\nFor questions, bug reports and suggestions please go to my discord server: [url=https://discord.gg/YRYS3ajZcQ][img]https://i.imgur.com/Yrqln75.png[/img][/url]",
