- Fixed the context menu behaving weird from time to time.
- Time! Now you can set your UTC offset, and all the messages will have their time printed correctly. (Note: in future versions of OSB will be detected automatically )
- Fonts! A new plugin for OSB that supports changing the fonts used in chat.
